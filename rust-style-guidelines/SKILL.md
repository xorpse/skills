# Rust style guidelines

Ensure the entire codebase adheres to the guidelines below. There should be no exceptions to these guidelines, failure to enforce them will result in a failed review.

<guidelines>
Follow these instructions strictly to ensure high-quality Rust code:

- Do not use emojis and avoid excessive comments. Write self-explanatory code instead.

- Do not use decorations around println, etc.

- For naming conventions, use British spelling vs American spelling for types/function names, e.g., analyse vs analyze, deserialise vs. deserialize, so things are consistent.

- Consistentently name types and methods.

- Provide accessors and mutators for struct fields, avoid `pub` fields. E.g., for a field named `timeout`, provide:
  ```rust
  fn timeout(&self) -> ... { ... }
  fn set_timeout(&mut self, to: ...) { ... }

- Use fluent style method names.

- Organise your imports in the following order: 1) standard library imports, 2) external library imports next, 3) same crate imports next. Use appropriate whitespace to separate groups of related imports. 

- Do not nest multiple modules when grouping imports. DO NOT do this: `use module1::blah::{module2::bleep::Type, module3::Bleh}`.

This is correct usage:
  ```rust
  use module1::blah::module2::bleep::Type;
  use module1::blah::module3::Bleh;
  ```

This is also correct usage:
  ```rust
  use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};
  use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

  use serde::Serialize;
  use tokio::fs;

  use crate::models::DataModel;
  use crate::utils::helper;
  ```

This is NOT correct usage:
    ```rust
    use std::collections::{collections::{HashMap, HashSet}, path::{Path, PathBuf}};
    ```

This is NOT correct usage:
    ```rust
    use std::collections::HashMap;
    use std::collections::HashSet;
    ```

- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code.

- For module layout, use mod.rs and directories when a module may have sub-modules or module_name.rs for leaf modules. Do not use new-style module paths.

- For error handling, in libraries always use thiserror and define many specific error types, rather than one general one.

- For error messages, always use lower-case unless you have a proper noun or acronym at the start of the string, i.e., prefer “component not found: reason” over “Component not found: Reason”, but keep "I/O error: reason" and "HTTP error: reason".

- Make use of “borrowed” types rather than owned variants if possible:
    - Prefer `impl AsRef<Borrowed>` vs `&Owned` or `impl AsRef<Owned>` unless the owned variant is really needed.
    - Prefer `impl AsRef<str>` or `&str` over `&String`
    - Prefer `impl AsRef<[u8]>` or `&[u8]` over `&Vec<u8>`
    - Prefer `impl AsRef<Path>` or `&Path` over `&PathBuf`

- Avoid usage of `to_string` on ``&str``  and opt for `to_owned` or `String::from` instead.

- Avoid useless imports, e.g, `use log;`; this is superfluous, since `log` will already be in scope if you have `log` as a dependency.

- For collections, prefer `Vec::new()` over `vec![]` for empty vectors.

- When using `Option` and `Result`, prefer the `?` operator for propagating errors and unwrapping values instead of using `.unwrap()` or `.expect()`.

- When implementing traits, ensure that the trait methods are implemented consistently and idiomatically. Do not add convenience methods that imply a particular implementation path for trait methods, e.g., do not add `read_value_from_memory` when implementing a `read_values_from_memory` method; the implementation should determine how best to read values.

- Do not annotate types via their let bindings, alwaysuse turbo-fish syntax or rely on type inference. For example, use:
  ```rust
  let value = Vec::<u8>::new();
  ```
  or
  ```rust
  let value = Vec::new();
  ```
  over
  ```rust
  let value: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();
  ```

- When formatting to build strings, log, or to print to the console, ensure we use the following:

    ```rust
    let name = "Alice";
    let greeting = format!("Hello, {name}!");
    println!("Hello, {name}!");
    ```

    DO NOT:

    ```rust
    let name = "Alice";
    let greeting = format!("Hello, {}!", name);
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
    ```
